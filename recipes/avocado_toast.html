    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      While you may think the best sandwiches contain several ingredients, by
      picking only two ingredients that complement each other, such as tomatoes
      and avocado in this recipe from Saveur, you can create a tasty and
      nutritious vegetarian lunch or dinner option that serves as an excellent
      source of vitamin C and healthy fats.
